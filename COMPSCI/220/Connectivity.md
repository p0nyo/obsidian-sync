### Graphs
###### Connected Graph

- If there is a path to each vertex from each vertex
###### Disconnected Graph

- If a vertex cannot be accessed through all of the vertices
### Digraphs
###### Strongly Connected Digraph
- For two nodes, `u,v` they are strongly connected if there is a path `(u,v)` and `(v,u)`

- Strongly connected components are {1, 2}
