Digraph:
$$G = (V,E)$$
Sub-Digraph:
$$G'=(V',E'),\ where\ V'\ \subseteq \ V\ and \ E'\ \subseteq\ E$$
Reverse Digraph:
- Where all the arrows are just reversed
$$G_r=(V,E')\ where\ (u,v)\in E'\ only\ if\ (v,u)\in E$$
Spanning Sub-Digraph:
- All nodes are present but not all arcs
$$V' = V$$
Induced Sub-Digraph:
- Taking a set of nodes from graph, we save all the arcs associated
Underlying Graph:
- Taking away the directions of a digraph

Graph Union:
- For graphs G1 and G2:
$$G_1=(V_1, E_1)$$
$$G_2=(V_2, E_2)$$
- The union of the vertices and edges is the union of the graphs
$$G=(V_1\cup V_2,\ E_1\cup E_2)$$
