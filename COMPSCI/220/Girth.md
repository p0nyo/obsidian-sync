The girth of a graph `G` is the length of the shortest path on the graph
The girth of digraph `G` is the girth of the ==underlying graph== `G`
The directed girth of digraph

- Girth = 3, underlying graph `G` is on the right
- Directed Girth = 2, shortest cycle

- Girth = 3, underlying graph `G` is on the left
- Directed Girth = 2, shortest cycle
