##### Storage as a Constructive Process
- Memory is not a flawless recorder of our life experiences
- At each stage, most information is lost and remaining little is transformed
- Construction involves using bits and pieces of this information to build a reasonable understanding of the world![[Pasted image 20240607180527.png]]
**Saccades**:
- Periodic snapshots. of the visual field, gaps are filled-in to create the perception of continuity
**Similarly**:
- Same as saccades but auditory
**Ambiguous Stimuli**
- Sensory input that could be perceived in two or more ways
#### Processes
**Rehearsal**:
- Verbally repeating something over and over in a short period of time -> ROTE LEARNING (memorising)
	- Not so great way of storaging
**Meaningful Learning**:
- Associating new information with existing information (prior knowledge) -> UNDERSTANDING (comprehension)
**Internal Organisation**:
- When information is interconnected in some way -> organisational schemes/schema
- Chunking 
**Elaboration**:
- Elaboration involves the use of prior knowledge but adding new information by themselves, their own interpretations
- Learning more than the material presented

#### Factors Affecting LTM Storage
**Working Memory**:
- Limited capacity of WM is why multitasking is not effective in storage and retrieval
- Effective LTM storage is demanding, requires us to make connections between new stimuli (sensory registers) and prior knowledge (stored in LTM)
**Prior Knowledge and Misconceptions**:
- PK -> what we know 
- PM -> what we know but wrong
- Both stored in LTM
**Expectations**:
- Created by prior knowledge and beliefs that influence how we encode and store new info
	- Priming, halo and horns effect
	- Halo -> do better because greater expections
	- Horns -> do worse because lower expectations
**Verbalisation**:
- Talking and writing about an idea or experience can help storage and retrieval -> self-explanation
**Enactment, Repetition and Review**:
- Doing and practicing
- Distributed practice -> spacing effect -> long-term retention
**Development of Automaticity**:
- Controlled Processing
	- Demanding, requiring conscious attention
- Automatic Processing
	- Occurs with very little or no conscious attention![[Pasted image 20240607183101.png]]
	- Develops gradually over time and exists on a continuum
