Mike found that there was just so much to read in  
his Stage Two Economics class. Even though he  
had taken Economics in high school, it was ==overwhelming== and there ==seemed no way of simplifying it to make greater sense==. He just hoped that by reading notes over and over and by highlighting them something would stick.
1. (Difficulty 1) Overwhelming amount of content to learn
	1. (Strategy 1) Chunking information
		- Breaking down the information into more manageable "chunks" where he can focus on one "chunk" before moving to the next one, this helps to reduce the cognitive load and makes the information that he has to learn less overwhelming
	2. (Strategy 2) Spaced Repetition
		- Studying the information over a period of time instead of trying to study it all on one day. By doing this, he is able to reinforce the content he learnt everyday, which will in turn store the information for longer in his long term memory.
1. (Difficulty 2) Ineffective Study Techniques
	- His current study technique is poor and ineffective as he is just letting information be poured into his working memory since he is making no effort to actually process and store the information in his LTM
	1. (Strategy 1) Summarising
		- After reading a section in his workbook, he should focus on summarising that chapter. This will help to force him to understand the content because he will have to rephrase and pick out the more important ideas in the content. 
	2. (Strategy 2) Comprehension Monitoring
		- During his summarising, he can also check where his learning is at by questioning himself to check whether or not he actually understands the content he is learning. This can help him realise what gaps he has in his knowledge as well as reducing the amount of time spent relearning content that is already well stored in his LTM by focusing just on the content that is missing.

mind maps work too
- helps to visualise the content and its' relationships
