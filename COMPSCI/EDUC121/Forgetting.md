2. **Interference**
	1. *Proactive*
		- When past information interferes in a forward acting way while learning new information
		- e.g Keep using old email password
	2. *Retroactive*
		- When new information interferes in a backward acting way to old information learnt
		- e.g Can't recite old dance moves after learning new one
3. **Repression**
	- The forgetting of painful events as a defence mechanism (conscious or subconscious effort not to retrieve them)
4. **Failure to Retrieve**
	- Looking in the wrong places to retrieve
5. **Construction Error**
	- The incorrect reconstruction of past memories
	- More likely to happen when memory has lots of holes
6. **Insufficient Self-Monitoring during Retrieval**
	- Failure to reflect on recollections in order to ensure their validity
7. **Failure to Store or Consolidate**
