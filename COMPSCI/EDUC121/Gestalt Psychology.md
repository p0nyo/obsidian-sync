1. Perception is often different from reality
	- People will come to their own conclusions (perception) about an experience if they do not know the full story
2. The whole is more than the sum of its parts
	- Human experience can't be fully understood if various aspects of experience are studied as separate entities
	- Phi phenomenon -> we perceive the illusion of movement when only two or more lights are present, not when there is only a single light
3. People are predisposed to organise experiences and to do so in predictable ways
	- People tend to structure their experiences in similar, predictable ways
	- People tend to perceive as a unit those things that are close together in space
		- E.g:
			- ONE VERY HIGH WAY
			- ON EVERY HIGHWAY
	- **Law of Similarity**
		- People tend to perceive as a unit those things that physically resemble one another
	- **Law of Closure**
		- People tend to fill in missing pieces to form a complete picture
4. Learning follows the Law of Praganz
