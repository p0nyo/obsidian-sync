The intentional use of one or more cognitive processes to accomplish a particular learning task.
1. **Meaningful Learning, Organisation and Elaboration**
	- Link to [[LTM Storage]]
	- **Approach 1**
		- Creating an outline of major topics and ideas to know what they need to study
	- **Approach 2**
		- Incorporating new material in a graphic representation e.g timeline of historical events
		- Mind/Concept Maps
2. **Note Taking**
	- Keeps attention on material being presented, facilitates encoding of the information and serves as a form of concrete external storage 
	- Helps when teachers give structure to their lessons
3. **Identifying Important Information**
4. **Summarising**
	- Deriving abstract representations
	- Identifying suitable headings to label
	- Similar to identifying important information
5. **Comprehension Monitoring**
	- Periodically making sure you are understanding and remembering the information being noted down (self-evaluate their learning)
		1. Asking yourself questions (Self questioning)
		2. Check yourself piece by piece
			- Basically go through each topic and subtopic
	- *Illusion of knowing*
		- When material is difficult and they have 0 prior knowledge
6. **Mnemonics**
	- Tricks to learning hard to remember material
	1. *Verbal Mediation*
		- E.g German word (der Hund), English meaning (dog), Mediator (hound)
	2. *Visual Imagery*
		- Connecting ideas to concrete visual constructs
		1. *Method of Loci*
			- Think of familiar route and link landmarks on that route to major ideas
		2. Pegword Method
			- Using a well-known list of items that serve as "pegs" in which another list can be "hung" onto each item through visual imagery
		3. Keyword Method
			- Similar to verbal mediation but with extra steps
			- E.g German Word (das Pferd), English Meaning (Horse), Keyword (Ford), Visual Imagery (Horse driving a ford)
7. **Superimpose Meaningful Structure**
	- Acronyms, Songs, Stories, Sentences that relate to the information learnt
8. **Conceptual Understanding**:
    - The importance of meaningful learning over rote memorization is emphasized. Understanding underlying concepts and principles helps in applying knowledge more effectively.
9. **Application-Based Learning**:
    - The benefits of applying knowledge in practical tasks and real-world scenarios. This approach helps in solidifying understanding and enhancing the ability to transfer knowledge to different contexts.
