#### Processes
**Spreading Activation**:
- A process of activation flowing through connections within network of stored information
- Might be an idea triggered by something in the environment
- Travelling through our brain like a mindmap
- Can retrieve things easily when we visit them regularly
**Encoding Specificity**:
- Retrieval is easier when we use the same or similar though processes we used during storage6
	- Context-Dependent
		- External, environmental factors
		- e.g rooms, outside/inside when we remember things
		- We retrieve a memory more easily when in the same context as when we formed the memory
	- State and Mood Dependent
		- Internal physiological and/or emotional factors
		- e.g happy, sad when we remember things
#### Measures of Retrieval
**Free Recall**:
- Test of LTM that involves retrieving memories without cues
	- E.g Write down as much as you can about Lecture One
**Cued Recall**:
- Test of LTM that involves. remembering an item of information in response to a retrieval cue
	- E.g. flashcards
**Recognition**:
- Involves identifying correct information from a series of possible choices
	- E.g multiple choice
**Relearning**:
- Involves measuring how much time it takes to relearn and regain mastery of previously learned material
##### Memory Errors and Distortions
- Memories altered everytime we recall them (reconstructed), then altered again when reconsolidating the memory back into LTM

- Locus of Source Amnesia
	- Forgetting how memory was stored
- Nature of Source Amnesia
	- Info from unreliable source treated as reliable
