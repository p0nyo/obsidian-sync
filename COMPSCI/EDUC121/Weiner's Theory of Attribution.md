Attributions are the way people explain their successes or failures
- People interpret new events with existing knowledge + beliefs about themselves and the world around them -> then develop a reasonable explanation for why things have happened
- E.g I got a bad grade because the examiners made the test too hard this year
Three Key Dimension of the Theory of Attribution
1. **Locus** *("place"): Internal vs External*
	- Internal are the factors within ourselves
		- E.g Lack of ability
	- External are the factors outside of ourselves
		- E.g Lucky to receive award instead of hardwork
2. **Temporal Stability** *Stable vs Unstable*
	- Stable are things that won't change much in the near future
		- E.g Ugly because born with big nose
	- Unstable are things that are always change
		- E.g Winning football match because of a fluke
3. **Controllability** *Controllable vs Uncontrollable*
	- Controllable are things we can influence and change
		- E.g Fail test because you didn't study
	- Uncontrollable are things we can't influence or change
		- E.g Someone robbing you because you happened to walk down a certain street at a certain time
