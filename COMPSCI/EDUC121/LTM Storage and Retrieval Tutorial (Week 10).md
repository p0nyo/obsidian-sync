##### Scenario 1
Melody is a music major, and she is taking a course focused on learning how to play the piano and related musical theory. Melody was struggling in the part of the course that focused on musical theory, in particular, learning the many different scales and modes. She would be given a brief overview of the scales and modes, told how they were constructed, and then given a pictorial version of them to learn and memorise. Melody would go home and try to memorise the scales and modes by repeating them over and over again in attempts to memorise them, occasionally stopping to see how well her memorisation of them was progressing. However, due to the amount of information to be learned, she found it difficult to memorise all the scales and modes this way and ==felt overwhelmed by the information==. In addition, she found herself getting the scales and modes confused and ==mixed up with each other== and also with those that she had previously learnt. When she did memorise a scale or a mode, she was learning in her course  
on playing pianos, she had ==difficulty transferring and utilising this knowledge when playing other keyboard instruments==, e.g., organs. Finally, Melody could not use her knowledge of scales/modes effectively when writing music. She seemed limited in her ability to use scales/modes in the form and context that she learned it and was ==limited by exactly what she had memorised.==
