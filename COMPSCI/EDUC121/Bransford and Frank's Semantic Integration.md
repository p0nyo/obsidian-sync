Undergraduate students listened to 24 sentences and answered simple questions about each one.

Sentences were variations on four general ideas: rock rolling down a hill, a man reading a newspaper, a breeze blowing and ants eating jelly.

The six sentences:
- The ants ate the sweet jelly which was on the table
- The ants in the kitchen ate the jelly which was on the table
- The ants in the kitchen ate the jelly
- The ants ate the sweet jelly
- The ants were in the kitchen
- The jelly was on the table

Students then listened to a second set of 28 sentences, 24/28 were new sentences. They were asked to indicate whether or not each of them had been in the first set or not

Examples:
- The ants in the kitchen ate the sweet jelly which was on the table
- The ants in the kitchen ate the sweet jelly
- The ants ate the jelly which was on the table
- The jelly was sweet

Students "recognised" the ones that contained a lot of information

#### Conclusion
- People construct general ideas from the many tidbits of information they receive and organise similar ideas together
- Sentences in the experiment which included most or all of the information related to a single theme may have more closely resembled the students' organised memories and so seemed more familiar
- They did not observe the mental change of a person, but they came to a reasonable explanation about their mental change based on the behaviours that they did see
