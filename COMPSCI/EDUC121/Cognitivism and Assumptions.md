#### 1. Major Assumptions
1. Some learning processes may be unique to human beings 
	- Because people possess abilities unique to the species
	- Theories formulated from cognitivism are not generalised to other species
2. Learning involves an internal, mental change rather than an external behaviour change
3. People are actively involved in their own learning
	- People are not held back by their environmental conditions, but rather by the way they mentally process their experiences
4. Knowledge is organised
	- All the knowledge someone possesses is linked
	- People will learn more effectively when they. relate new information and experiences to things they already know
5. The focus of scientific inquiry must be on objective, systematic observations of people's behaviours, but behaviours often allow reasonable inferences about unobservable mental processes
	- Can come to conclusions about their unobservable mental processes through observations of people's behaviours
