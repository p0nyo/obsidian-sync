1. Learning is an internal change
	- 3 groups of rats in a maze
		1. Food
		2. No food
		3. Food at day 11
	- Group 3 rats did better than Group 2 rats after being given food
	- Used the term **latent learning** to describe this unobservable change in learning
		- Learning that occurs but is not observable until there is a reason to demonstrate it
2. Behaviour is purposive
	- The process of learning that certain events lead to other events
		- E.g following a path through a maze leads to reinforcement
3. Expectations affect behaviour
	- Two groups, group 1 given a yum treat while group 2 given a mid treat
	- Group 1 expect yum treat so they do maze faster
	- Group 2 expect mid treat so they do maze slower
		- If group 1 was given a mid treat later on their performance would drop more than group 2's
		- Their performance was due to the change in reinforcement
4. Learning results in an organised body of information
	- Rats who run a maze appear to learn the general arrangement of the maze

	- Rats go to path 6 because they know that the food is in that direction instead of path 10 or 9 which was the previous path that led to the food
