1.  Identify the last component of memory in which the information has been stored
2. Identify one problem that might explain why the learning was not effective
3. Link the evidence from the scenario/explanation to the relevant component of the IPM
#### Scenario 1
Thursday night, Jennifer studies for a test on Friday morning. She remembers the material quite accurately on Friday and gets an A on the test. When she takes a review test two months later, however, she can no longer remember the same material.
1. The last component of memory that Jennifer stored the test in was her LTM. Jennifer was able to retrieve the information the next day, indicating that it was indeed stored in LTM.
2. The learning might've not been effective because the information that was stored in Jennifer's LTM was not properly consolidated, which is the process of transforming information from temporary to permanent
3. The information was stored with encoding in the LTM, but it was not properly consolidated, either from a weak encoding or with a lack of practice and reinforcement over time to keep the memory accessible 
#### Scenario 2
Justin is trying to learn new information in his textbook. His eyes are focused on the words in front of him, but he is thinking about the fishing trip he has planned for the weekend.
1. The last component in memory where Justin stored the new information was in his Sensory Memory because although his eyes were staring at the page, none of the visual input was actually being processed and being sent to his WM since he was being distracted by the thought of the fishing trip he planned
2. Lack of attention, he was not paying attention to the words on the textbook so nothing was being moved to his WM.
3. Attention is crucial for selecting incoming stimuli to be sent to the WM. Words were in sensory memory but without attention they will not move
#### Scenario 3
After her French teacher says, “Merci beaucoup,” Josephine repeats the phrase, then she immediately turns to talk to her friend.
1. The information that the teacher says gets into her WM as she was able to repeat it back to the teacher
2. By immediately talk to her friend, Josephine does not encode the given information to the LTM and she will most likely forget the phrase soon
3. Encoding + LTM: she didn't take the extra time to properly put the knowledge into her LTM
