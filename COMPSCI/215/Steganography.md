- Hiding information within some cover media
	- E.g Hiding a text message in an image
![[Pasted image 20240520144426.png|350]]
- Each pixel is 8 bits long (0 - 255 Values)
- 0 = white and 255 = black
- If we were to increment or decrement the pixel with value 140 by 1 to 141 or 139, we wouldn't be able to tell difference
