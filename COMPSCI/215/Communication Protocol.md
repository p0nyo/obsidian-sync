Defines how hosts and interfaces in a communication exchange information
- Determines possible actions of a host or interface given the ==current state of communication== and ==events== that may occur
- Determines ==format, syntax and semantics== of information exchange
- Gives directions on how the communication can synchronise and recover from errors

### Protocol Correctness
- Complete set of states, including error and unsynchronised states
- The ==right event== for ==every event== that may occur in any state
- Unambiguous formats, syntax and semantics
