Essentially arithmetic over a range of integers from 0 to *n*, *n* is known as the modulus
$$e.g\;\;n = 8$$
- Do math as you normally would, but:
	1. If you get a result that is larger than n-1, then divide the result by *n* and take the remainder instead
	2. If the result is < 0, then add the smallest multiple of *n* that makes the result non-negative
$$e.g\;\;\;5-10=-5,\;if\;n=8,\;then\;-5+8=3$$
### Integer Division
$$7/3=2r1$$
- The same as 7 mod 3 = 1
- Mod basically gives the remainder
